Read the Problem-Statement to know in detail about assignment.
In short we are given is the complete code for the Ping server. The task is to write the Ping client.

To check the functionality of the UDP pinger run `python pingserver.py` in the terminal first. This would start-up the server.
Then run `python clien.py` in another terminal where you would be able to see the ping messages, RTTs and time-outs if any.
